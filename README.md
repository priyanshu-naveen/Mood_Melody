MoodMelody – Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System

MoodMelody is an intelligent music recommendation system designed to play songs that match the user’s current mood. The project uses facial emotion recognition and sentiment analysis techniques to identify the user’s emotional state—such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, or neutral—and automatically suggests or plays music that aligns with that mood. The system employs machine learning models like CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for emotion detection from facial expressions captured through a webcam. It then maps the detected emotion to a pre-classified music dataset or online playlist.

The goal of MoodMelody is to enhance the user’s listening experience by providing personalized music choices based on emotions, creating a deeper emotional connection with the music. The project integrates technologies such as Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and a music API (like Spotify or a local music library). The user interface is simple and interactive, allowing manual mood selection as well.

Overall, MoodMelody demonstrates how artificial intelligence and human emotion can work together to make technology more personalized and empathetic. It can be further expanded for use in smart devices, mental wellness apps, or entertainment platforms.
